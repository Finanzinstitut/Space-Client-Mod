 * hitting you: a number that has gone from 3 to 2 is noticed without looking
 * away from the fight, and a grid of icons is not.
 *
 * The set is deliberately short. Totems, gapples, pearls and arrows are the
 * items whose count changes what you do next; adding blocks and swords to the
 * list would turn a glance back into a read.
