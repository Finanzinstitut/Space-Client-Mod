/**
 * Where you are standing in the other dimension.
 *
 * Linking portals is arithmetic done badly by hand: divide by eight in the
 * overworld, multiply by eight in the nether, and get one of them backwards at
 * some point. Almost every client shows coordinates and none of them show this,
 * which is odd, because the conversion is the only time the number is hard.
 *
 * The dimension is read reflectively and matched on its name. `dimension()`
 * returns a registry key whose text ends in `the_nether`, and matching the text
 * survives the method being renamed in a way a cast would not - and the cost of
 * being wrong is a label that says overworld while you stand in the nether,
 * not a crash.
