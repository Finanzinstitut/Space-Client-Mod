/**
 * Your inventory, without opening it.
 *
 * The thing this is actually for: in a fight, opening the inventory means
 * standing still with the screen covered, and the two questions people open it
 * to answer - how many totems are left, is there another gapple - take a glance
 * to read and a lifetime to ask for. Showing the grid permanently removes the
 * pause entirely.
 *
 * Only the three storage rows. No avatar, no crafting grid, no armour slots:
 * the avatar and crafting are decoration in this context, and the armour is
 * already its own element. What is left is the part that answers the question.
 *
 * Slots 9 to 35 are those three rows. Slots 0 to 8 are the hotbar, which is
 * already on screen, so it is off by default and available for anyone who
 * would rather have everything in one block.
