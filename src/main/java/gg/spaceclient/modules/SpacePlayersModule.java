/**
 * How many people are playing with Space Client right now.

 * world, which was the more interesting number and the reason it had to go: it
 * reported players you cannot see, including through walls and behind you. A
 * count is less than a position, but it is still information about people the
 * game was not showing you, and that is the line this client does not cross.
 *
 * The roster is already fetched for the name tag badge, so this costs nothing
 * that was not already being paid.
