/**
 * Scales what a HUD element draws.
 *
 * Through reflection, following the rule the rest of this mod uses: anything
 * proven by a successful compile is called directly, anything guessed goes
 * through reflection. This is guessed, for a specific reason - Mojang replaced
 * the GUI's PoseStack with a two dimensional matrix stack a few versions ago,
 * so the calls are either pushPose/popPose with three-argument transforms or
 * pushMatrix/popMatrix with two.
 *
 * The methods are looked up once and remembered. Searching per frame would be
 * wasteful, but the real reason is correctness: reflective calls to void
 * methods return null whether they worked or not, so "did that succeed" cannot
 * be answered after the fact and has to be settled before the first call.
 *
 * A version this does not recognise costs the scaling and nothing else - every
 * element draws at its natural size, exactly as it did before scaling existed.
