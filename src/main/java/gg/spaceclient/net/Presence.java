/**
 * Who is playing with Space Client right now, so the name tag can say so.
 *
 * The distinction matters and was wrong at first: the roster used to be every
 * account that had ever registered, so anyone who tried the client once kept
 * the badge forever, including while playing vanilla. Presence is now a
 * separate, expiring signal - a heartbeat while in a world, dropped on the way
 * out - and the permanent record is kept only for counting installs.
 *
 * Deliberately built the opposite way round from NowPlayingShare, and the
 * reason is the free KV quota rather than taste.
 *
 * NowPlayingShare asks the worker about the specific players it can see, every
 * ten seconds, because a song changes constantly and only matters for people
 * in view. Badge membership does neither: it changes when somebody installs
 * the client, which is roughly never, and it is the same answer for everybody.
 * So this fetches the whole roster instead - one request, one cached answer -
 * and every "does this player have a badge" check afterwards is a set lookup
 * with no network and no storage behind it.
 *
 * That distinction is what keeps the badge off the KV bill. Per-player polling
 * at now-playing rates would cost one list operation per client per poll, and
 * the free tier allows a thousand a day in total.
 *
 * The roster is not cleared on disconnect. It is not per world, and a player
 * who rejoins two minutes later would otherwise pay for a fresh fetch to learn
 * exactly what it already knew.
